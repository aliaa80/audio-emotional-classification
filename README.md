# audio emotional classification
Classify a speech dataset by their emotions using some classification models

The dataset I used is:

https://github.com/pariajm/sharif-emotional-speech-dataset

and you can download audio files and json file from this repo.

I used many diffrent classification models such as SVC, RandomForest, Knn, DecisionTree and MLP and best result I got was for MLP that it's accuracy was 74%.

Of course it's not a very good accuracy because this dataset isn't really balanced.
